You come to life. Your strength is (print: $strength), your beauty is

You pick up the dice and weigh them in your hand. They feel lighter than usual.
You toss them onto the table and look at the results: a (random: 2,12).

The aliten balls his hands into fists. &quot;I could beat you to a bloody pulp for taking my seat, &quot; he says casually, but I&#39;l give you a chance to get out of this bar alive. Just give me my seat if you want ot live.&quot;

and begins to shuffle them around the table. You watch carefully at first but soon
grow confused, unable to tell where the stone is located.

You start to point to a cup, but the busker holds up his hand. &quot;Remember, two
of these cups contain enough explosive powder to blow you into the center of
the ocean. Sure you know where the stone is?&quot;

You aren&#39;t sure, but you don&#39;t really have a choice to walk away. You need to
get that stone.

You wonder if he&#39;d give you a [hint.]&lt;hint|

Do you choose the [[first cup ex|Explosion]], [[second cup win|You Win]],
or [[third cup mouseover|Explosion]]?

understanding -- and did I mention, handsome -- Naxon. Please spare my life.
You can have the contents of my backpack if you leave me unharmed.&quot;

&quot;Naxon?&quot; the alien says. &quot;You think I&#39;m a Naxon?&quot;

The alien grins at you gleefully and transforms himself into a Deerdon,
a boring, chameleon-like alien that can change itself to resemble whatever
it encounters. Deerdons aren&#39;t dangerous at all, and now you look ridiculous
for groveling to a lowly alien.

&quot;Though I will take your backpack. Thanks!&quot; he says, grabbing your bag from the
floor. Before you can react, he&#39;s out the door, and you&#39;re out on the streets.
Without any money or possessions, you have no chance of staying in the
Lonely Asteroid tonight.

The end.

You are facing two doors. One is a beautiful, shimmery blue that
looks as if it is made out of water. The other is a dark, dingy
door with a spider web clinging to the edge.

Do you want to open [[the blue door?|Blue Door]]
Or do you want to open [[the black door?|Black Door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Lie" tags="" position="657,235" size="100,100">&quot;I&#39;m happy to give you this seat,&quot; you tell the alien, &quot;though I&#39;m not sure you
want it considering that I&#39;m about to smear erbium all over the tabletop.
Are you sure?&quot;

The alien gulps and glances at your pocket. &quot;I guess it depends on the erbium.
Can I see it?&quot;

You don&#39;t actually have any erbium.

You start to panic and look around for a potential weapon, something heavy that
you can chuck right at this Naxon. You see a salt shaker, but unfortunately,
it is several seats away, and the alien is staring right at you.

Do you [[distract the alien|Grab Shaker]] and grab the salt shaker? Or do you
admit that [[you don&#39;t have any erbium|Admit]] after all?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Run" tags="" position="829,26" size="100,100">&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; you call hastily over your shoulder as you dart out of the
inn. You don&#39;t realize until you&#39;re on the street that you left your bag at the
bar. There&#39;s no way that you&#39;re going back inside, but there&#39;s also no way off
this planet without your spaceship key and wallet.

Do you risk [[returning to the inn|End]] and having to deal with the Naxon?
Or do you [[wander around the planet|End]], trying to find another way to get home?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Grab Shaker" tags="" position="834,392" size="100,100">You point over the alien&#39;s shoulder and shout &quot;look out!&quot; Luckily the Naxon is
quite gullible. While he turns to look, you snatch a metal salt shaker and
brandish it over your head as if about to throw it. It isn&#39;t exactly the most
frightening weapon, but it does the trick. The alien backs away, croaking about how
it is hard to tell the difference between salt shakers and erbium shakers.

You forgot how much salt resembles erbium!

You sigh with relief and try to sit down in your seat, but something is occupying
the spot. Remember how Naxons can make themselves invisible? Well, one has slipped
into the vacant chair while you argued with the other Naxon.

As he makes himself corporeal, you can see that he&#39;s not only glaring at you
but has green goo oozing from between his fingers.

Do you [[jump behind the bar|Behind Bar]] to put some distance between you,
do you [[fight this new Naxon|Fight New Naxon]], or do you [[run|Run]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Admit" tags="" position="941,274" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Blue Door" tags="" position="23,232" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Black Door" tags="" position="118,347" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Behind Bar" tags="" position="705,609" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Fight New Naxon" tags="" position="888,603" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="End" tags="" position="1029,73" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Explosion" tags="" position="329,490" size="100,100">[You turn on the light in the room.]&lt;light|(click-replace: ?light)[There is only
