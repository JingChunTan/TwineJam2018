Most of the Martian atmosphere has been brutally stripped away by solar winds. Unlike Earth, Mars is missing a strong magnetic field, which leaves it vulnerable to solar storms. No magnetic field and almost no atmosphere mean the surface is being showered with solar particles and cosmic rays. The intense radiation that gets through will kill you in months. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Ending 5 Food Poisioning" tags="" position="523,1340" size="100,100">Alien gift food without understanding human physiology

Works best with Choose Your Own Adventure style.

This is both the simplest structure, and the one capable of the most variety in story. It lends itself well to improvisational writing: describe a situation, think of two reactions, then see where they lead you!

Make sure to have a mix of &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; endings. Some CYOA books have one &#39;ideal&#39; ending, while others are written in such a way that no one path is &#39;better&#39; than any other. Pick an approach and experiment!

In this template, every passage has two choices. This is in the style of the classic CYOA books.

This was the start of the gold rush, which lasted from 1849 to 1856.
Few miners made their fortune from gold. But they spent the savings they had used to go mining with, and this kick-started the California economy. When the men finally gave up their hopes for gold, they moved onto the land and settled there as farmers.

In time, mining camps such as Virginia City became large towns on Mars.

Over time, winds sculpted the rocks into some beautiful formations. But researchers will need more study to learn how these volcanoes formed Medusae Fossae. The formation may have formed from immensely huge volcanic eruptions taking place hundreds of times over 500 million years. These eruptions would have warmed the Red Planet&#39;s climate as greenhouse gases from the volcanoes drifted into the atmosphere.

[[Investigate | Investigate ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Hale Crater" tags="" position="1034,605" size="100,100">Mars is host to strange features called recurring slope lineae, which tend to form on the sides of steep craters during warm weather. It&#39;s hard to figure out what these RSL are, though. Pictures shown here from Hale Crater (as well as other locations) show spots where spectroscopy picked up signs of hydration. In 2015, NASA initially announced that the hydrated salts must be signs of running water on the surface, but later research said the RSL could be formed from atmospheric water or dry flows of sand. In reality, we may have to get up close to these RSL to see what their true nature is. But there&#39;s a difficulty — if the RSL indeed host alien microbes, we wouldn&#39;t want to get too close in case of contamination. While NASA figures out how to investigate under its planetary protection protocols, future human explorers may have to admire these mysterious features from afar, using binoculars.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="Robot Survey" tags="" position="693,891" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name=" Investigate " tags="" position="540.6666666666666,942" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name=" Run away" tags="" position="1051,1080" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
