To your right, there is a massive landslide, extending into a seemingly bottomless pit. In the distance, you caught sight of the glimmer of light through the gaps between the ghost dunes.

Works best with Choose Your Own Adventure style.

This is both the simplest structure, and the one capable of the most variety in story. It lends itself well to improvisational writing: describe a situation, think of two reactions, then see where they lead you!

Make sure to have a mix of &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; endings. Some CYOA books have one &#39;ideal&#39; ending, while others are written in such a way that no one path is &#39;better&#39; than any other. Pick an approach and experiment!

In this template, every passage has two choices. This is in the style of the classic CYOA books.

Hi &lt;span class = &quot;name&quot;&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;,

Fantastic! I am delighted to register you as an participant of &quot;Keeping Up with the Martians&quot;. As you&#39;re well aware, Mars is a very harsh and desolated place crawling with dangers - therefore, before we send you to the Cardassians, we require all contestants to undergo an Orientation Bootcamp in Cerberus Plains to prepare you for the challenges. 

You are going to spend a very long time there. Apart from the essentials such as oxygen supply and water, you are allowed to take one sentimental thing from Earth with you. 

What is it going to be?

Oculi&#39;s room is way too big for just one person. In front of the floor to ceiling windows, there&#39;s a huge desk that six people could comfortably eat around. It matches the couch. Everything else is white - ceiling, floors and walls except on the wall, where a small painting hang. They are exquisite - a series of objetcs painted in such precise detail they look like photographs. Displayed together, they are breathtaking. Aside from the art, the rest of the room is cold, clean and clinical.

It&#39;s Ben, your landlord. He is absolutely furious. The banging on the door gets more and more aggresive. You cover your ears, pretending not to hear. After what seemed like hours, he finally gave up, stopped cursing and left. 

You gatherd up your energy to get up, only to discover a piece of paper slipped through the crack in your door, its words printed in the largest glaring red font you can imagine:

&lt;h1&gt;48 Hours To Pay or Vacate!!!!!! &lt;/h1&gt;

You are three months behind your rent. Unless you can get your hands on a lot of money, you will be homeless with nowhere to live by the end of tomorrow, starving to death on the streets.

Hi &lt;span class = &quot;name&quot;&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;,

My name is Gamma and I&#39;m a reality show producer at Cardassian TV. I would like to congratulate you - you have been selected for a life-changing opportunity to meet the Cardassians and win a huge Space Currency prize! We will cover all your travel and food expenses.

I&#39;m currently working on an exciting intergalactic show called &quot;Keeping Up with the Cardassians&quot;, a competitive reality show in which the contestants are flew to Mars and isolated from the outside world to live in a bunker with the Cardassians, the most elite and beautiful Martian clan. Each week, the contestants are given a difficult challenge by the Cardassians and one of the contestants is eliminated, with the last contestant remaining winning a Trillion Space Currency prize. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon - see you there on Mars!

All the best,
Gamma

You reach out for the expired bread in the cupboard. It was the cheapest thing you could find on sale in the supermarket. Eating the exact same thing for evrey single meal makes you feel sick. It tasted like cupboard. 

That was the last piece of bread. You have no more money to afford anything.

I have lost my way and don&#39;t konw what to do. Could you please help me?&quot;

The alien smiled flirtatiously. &quot;Greetings, $name. It&#39;s not everyday I get to meet such a beautiful human as you.
