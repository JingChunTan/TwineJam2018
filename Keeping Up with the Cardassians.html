Your spaceship is totally broken and you need to find some help. You climb out of the ship and found yourself lost in the midst of a maze-like valley. Etched with an intricate pattern of landslides and wind-blown dunes, the planet looks completely desolated. To your right, there is a massive landslide, extending into a seemingly bottomless pit. In the distance, you caught sight of the glimmer of light through the gaps between the ghost dunes.

Hi &lt;span class = &quot;name&quot;&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;,

Fantastic! I am delighted to register you as an participant of &quot;Keeping Up with the Cardassians&quot;. As you&#39;re well aware, Mars is a very harsh and desolated place crawling with dangers - therefore, before we send you to the Cardassians, we require all contestants to undergo an Orientation Bootcamp in Cerberus Plains to prepare you for the challenges. 

You are going to spend a very long time there. Apart from the essentials such as oxygen supply and water, you are allowed to take one sentimental thing from Earth with you. 

What is it going to be?

Sunsets and sunrises are very spectacular, occurring every 45 minutes above Earth&#39;s atmosphere.

However, a strangest loud popping sound wakes you up from your daydream. It&#39;s coming from the outside, like a car backfiring.

The panels on the biodome are made of glass, and the walls are raised from below ground to block the dust from outside. In front of the giant windows, there&#39;s a huge dining table that ten people could comfortably eat around. Everything is white - ceiling, floors and walls. Aside from the various oxygen-pumping plants, the rest of the dining room is cold, clean and clinical.

&quot;You have such a lovely home. Thank you so much for letting me stay here! I have a small gift as a token to express my thanks.&quot;

Being extremely aware of Oculi&#39;s intense eyes, you blush furiously and gulp down the wine.

What you saw froze the blood in your veins.

The room is full of shelves. on these shelves, there are many transparent glass containers. inside each glass container, there is one pair of eyes. Those eyes float in the water with various different colours - blue, green, brown, black, hazel, violet...each of them blinks at you intermittently. On each wall, there are various samples of human hair. The floor is coverd with blood stains. In the room corner, heaps of skulls rose to the ceiling. 

The sickening smell makes you faint. 

&quot;So this is what Oculi has been collecting! When they come back, they will surely show their true colour and kill me to add my eyes to their collection...I need to get out of here!&quot;
